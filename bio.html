                earned a degree in philosophy from St. John’s College, and operated an art services corporation
                in Santa Fe. He then earned a doctorate in history from the University of New Mexico and
                taught for over twenty years at New Mexico State University. He specializes in 20th century U.S.
                History and Public History. He published two award-winning books – <a class="textLink" href="https://www.amazon.com/Inventing-Los-Alamos-Growth-Community/dp/0806138912/ref=sr_1_1?crid=35O5P32MQFS5U&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.ymWnwBj_3sr1AgVYsRYzxjZsddYw2wEcUHsRaj4nkllY8kloJQ9XngozWCFW7lCOXE05MDKrtEp6kekDm4Qg4Tm9JSfu6l8nX3Ws9itlpXw.Lso6_2480cA2erO-MvSKYs5YCLb8jqS3wekZ4jY5UPs&dib_tag=se&keywords=Jon+Hunner&qid=1708356733&sprefix=jon+hunner%2Caps%2C79&sr=8-1">Inventing Los Alamos</a>

Robert Oppenheimer, the Cold War, and the Atomic West</A> – and wrote numerous chapters
                and articles on a variety of topics including the history of the West, nuclear history,
                oral history, historic preservation, and living history. Over the years, he has worked with
                various communities in the United States as well as in Europe to preserve their heritages through
                restoring historic buildings, interviewing elders, and conducting living history events with
                students of all ages. On a sabbatical in 2016, he embarked on an extended road trip driving 65,000
                miles around the country to places where history actually happened. He visited 150 units of the
                National Park Service and 250 history museums and historic sites. From these travels, Hunner wrote
                Driven by The Past: A Road Trip Through the American West which is a place-based narrative of the
                history of the region. He currently lives in northern France where he and his wife are rehabilitating
                her family’s historic home where a young Mozart spent the night in 1763.

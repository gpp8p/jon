            A Fork in the Road: Birth of the National Parks

<div class="content">
    <p>Coming out of the Gilded Age, the United States reeled from the dislocations of industrialization, the crush of
        immigration, and the growth of labor unrest. Granted, inventions and innovation abounded and standards of living
        rose during the last part of the 19th century, but poverty and inequality cast a long shadow over the American
        Dream. The American West was isolated from the most severe of these disruptions, so by the turn of the 20th
        century, the region faced a fork in the road which transformed the nation for the rest of that century. We now
        follow that fork which changed government, businesses, and recreation by driving to some of the jewels in the
        crown of the National Park Service’s.</p>

        At Redwoods National and State Parks in northern California, the tallest living things in the world grow. Coastal
        redwoods grew upwards of 370 feet and more with tree trunks twenty-six feet in diameter. Some redwoods are as
        tall as the Statue of Liberty and reach the height of a thirty-story building. Standing at the base of a redwood
        with my fingers intertwined in its bark and looking up, I marveled at the size and age of such trees. Most trees
        are 500 to 700 years old with some older than 2,000 years. These ancient beings are not only the tallest living
        things on the planet, but some of the oldest.</p>

        </fig2>
        Redwoods thrive along the Pacific coast of northern California. Fog in the summer brings nourishing moisture, and
        lack of winter frost ensures a year-round growing season. Their bark is fire resistant and repels harmful
        insects. One ranger told me that the root system is their only weakness. Since these tall trees have no deep
        taproots, strong winds can blow them down. As I walked the paths, I stumbled on these roots as I looked up,
        enjoying the wonderous green canopy of the redwoods.</p>
    <p>Redwoods Parks is a joint venture between the NPS and California State Parks. Preservation started over 100 years
        ago as alarms grew about the logging of redwood groves. In 1918, the Save-the-Redwoods League formed and began
        buying up threatened groves that are now the Jedediah Smith, Del Norte Coast, and Prairie Creek Redwoods State
        Parks. While California’s state parks protected these tall trees, old growth forests outside of the state parks
        continue to fall.</p>
    <p>A survey by the National Geographic Society in the 1960s revealed that of the “original 2 million acres of virgin
        redwoods, only 300,000 acres, or 15 percent, remained uncut, with 50,000 of those acres in state parks.” This
        report galvanized many to seek further protection. The Sierra Club proposed a 90,000-acre park while the lumber
        industry countered with claiming that just the three existing state parks should become the national one.
        Congress compromised and established the 58,000-acre Redwood National Park in 1968 to add to the existing state
        parks.</p>

        Over the years, many people had called for the preservation of the redwoods, perhaps none so influential as John
        Muir. When Muir first arrived in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, he settled in Yosemite. He wrote about places of
        natural wonder around him: “Everybody needs beauty as well as bread, places to play in and pray in, where Nature
        may heal and cheer and give strength to body and soul.” Reveling in the holiness that surrounded him in the
        mountains, Muir proclaimed the benefits of preserving wilderness.</p>
    <p>A century ago, many Americans did not seek communion with sublime nature but saw the seemingly boundless
        resources in our continent mainly as sources for development and profit. Here’s where we reach the fork in the
        road. The laissez-faire capitalism of the Gilded Age dictated a hands-off policy by the government, that
        businesses could do what they want with their properties, even with public land. In fact, much of the public
        could not imagine government interfering with business nor with their personal lives. The Progressive Reform
        movement changed that mindset.</p>
    <p>Many factors transformed the laissez-faire attitude. As businesses and corporations increased in size and influence,
        calls for protection from their abuses also grew. Before Progressivism, lumber companies clear-cut publicly owned
        forests, left them denuded, and moved on to the next mountain. At the turn of the 20th century, a new utilitarian
        ethos about our natural resources emerged, asking what would bring the greatest good for the greatest number of
        people over the greatest period of time. This long view approach transformed the previous hands-off policies so that
        protecting old growth forests and our natural wonders now became a duty of the federal government. Throughout much
        of the 20th century, this utilitarian strategy has scientifically managed the resources on our public lands.</p>

        </fig2>
        A strong advocate for the preservation of nature was President Theodore Roosevelt. He worked to pass the
        Antiquities Act of 1906 which gave presidents the authority to protect public lands by declaring them off-limits
        to development as National Monuments. Within ten years, Presidents Roosevelt, Taft, and Wilson had created
        twenty-one National Monuments across the country, but no bureau existed to manage them or the existing fourteen
        National Parks like Yellowstone and Yosemite. Consequently, some parks lost valuable resources. For example,
        Yosemite National Park lost part of its land to San Francisco in 1913 when the Hetch Hetchy Valley was dammed to
        provide water for the Bay Area. This loss motivated conservationists to work for the creation of the National
        Park Service in 1916.</p>

        Stephen Mather, a wealthy Chicago businessman who loved visiting the existing parks, realized that they needed
        their own federal agency. Obviously, resource extraction companies fought against preserving these public lands.
        Additionally, some federal agencies did not want to share their lands with a bureau of national parks,
        especially the Department of Agriculture’s Forest Service. By emphasizing economic benefits of parks as a
        tourist draw, Mather won over congressmen to his cause, and President Wilson signed the enabling legislation
        creating the National Park Service on August 25, 1916.</p>

        As a new agency in the federal government, creating the NPS was a political act. In fact, creating any new park
        is a partisan act since our elected officials approve it. A convoluted example of this centers on the Grand
        Canyon. Ralph Cameron arrived at the Grand Canyon as a miner in 1890. In the coming years, he filed dubious
        mining claims so that he could charge fees to people hiking the Bright Angel Trail down to the Colorado River.
        In 1919, the Grand Canyon became a National Park, but Cameron continued to act as if he owned the trail that
        descended into the gorge from South Rim. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled against him, the NPS tried to dislodge
        him, but after he got elected as U.S. Senator from Arizona, he used his office to defund operational funding for
        the Grand Canyon. He continued to profit from tourists hiking on “his” Bright Angel Trail until 1926 when he
        lost his reelection bid, partially due to using his office to help him profit at the Canyon. The Bright Angel
        Trail became part of the NPS in 1928.</p>
    <p>Congressional opposition to the parks continues today. Some politicians fight new park proposals since they
        believe that the federal government should not own public lands except for national security purposes. The
        Center for American Progress found that from 2013 to 2016, conservative members of Congress introduced
        forty-four bills or amendments to strip away protection for national parks. Some in Congress have tried to
        devolve units of the NPS to state ownership. In fact, funding for the NPS has declined 15% from 2000 to 2020
        despite the addition of many more units. The NPS estimates that it has a backlog of deferred maintenance at its
        sites of billion of dollars. In the historic preservation field, we call this “demolition by neglect.” The
        Republican Party’s 2016 and 2020 official platforms stated: “Congress should reconsider whether parts of the
        federal government’s enormous landholdings and control of water in the west could be better used for ranching,
        mining or forestry through private ownership.” In the West where “whiskey is for drinking and water is for
        fighting,” those are fighting words for those who cherish our National Parks. Despite such ideological animosity
        to the NPS, the public supports preserving our natural wonders and historic sites. Just ask the over 300,000,000
        people who visit them every year.</p>
    <p>Muir Woods National Monument in the hills north of Golden Gate Bridge is an example of how the NPS started. A
        small unit of the NPS, its attraction is the soaring redwoods. The day we visited Muir Woods, many people ambled
        on the trails flanking the creek. We jumped off Redwood Creek Trail and quickly left the crowds as we hiked up
        Canopy View Trail. Hiking out of the small valley, breathing in the rich oxygen given off by these converters of
        carbon dioxide, I communed with the trees hundreds, even thousands of years old. Talking about these ancient
        beings at Muir Woods, my parkgonaut wife Cécile said: “Nature is so generous. It is eternity.” This is a magical
        place.</p>

        Back at the Visitor Center, we met two summer employees – Danielle and Brandon. These college students explained
        the acquisition of the park. In 1905, William and Elizabeth Thacher Kent paid $45,000 for this valley to save
        some of the last uncut stands of redwoods near San Francisco. After the 1906 earthquake, North Coast Water
        Company tried to gain access to the redwoods for lumber to help rebuild San Francisco, but the Kents thwarted
        this by donating 295 acres to the federal government. In 1908, President Teddy Roosevelt protected this property
        by proclaiming it a National Monument, and the Kents insisted that it be named to honor John Muir’s conservation
        efforts. William Kent, a Progressive member of the U.S. House of Representatives, then supported the protection
        of our natural resources and helped pass the Organic Act of 1916 which created the National Park Service. The
        history of the NPS reflects the continuing ebb and flow of public land policies between laissez-faire capitalism
        versus scientific management and preservation of our natural and cultural resources.</p>
    <p>Despite current political and funding fights, our parks enjoy robust popularity. To take care of the more
        300,000,000 annual visitors to the over 400 units of the NPS, three key groups of people make parks work:
        permanent NPS staff; seasonal employees who work during peak summer months; and volunteers. These days about
        20,000 people are paid to work at its 429 sites and over 200,000 additionally people donate their time to make
        the parks happen.</p>

        Here are just a few of the park people I met on my road trip through the American West. Retired elementary school
        teacher Tom at Ft. Clatsop in Oregon role-played being a sergeant in Lewis and Clark’s Corps of Discovery to a
        school group of fifth graders. Maria and Kay who volunteered at the Rosie the Riveter/World War II Home Front
        park near San Francisco were actual Rosies who welded together Liberty ships. Ranger Alisa at Manzanar NHS in
        California passionately told the story of Japanese American internment camps during World War II. These are just
        a few of the many people who I met and talked with on a wide variety of topics. I am a better historian hearing
        about our pasts from them, and I am a better citizen knowing that we have such dedicated, caring, and lively
        people preserving and interpreting our parks.</p>


    <p>
        Without these people today and without John Muir, Teddy Roosevelt, Elizabeth and William Kent, and thousands of
        others over the last 100 years, we might not have Muir Woods National Monument and Redwoods National and State
        Parks. We might not have Chaco Culture National Historic Park or Golden Spike National Historic Site or
        Manhattan project National Historical Parks. We probably would not even have the National Park Service. The deep
        yearning and dedication of many people to preserve our natural and historic sites enriches our country.</p>

    <p>

        Without the fork in the road which originated in the American West and led us away from unregulated capitalism,
        without all of the people who fought then and still do to protect these treasured places of natural wonder and
        historical significance, we would be a lesser country. And we would be a lesser world since the NPS has served
        as a model for the preservation of natural and historical places in almost 100 countries around the globe.</p>

    <p>Redwoods National Park was established on Oct. 2, 1968. It now has 105,516 acres. In 1980, it was designated an
        UNESCO World Heritage Site. Muir Woods was proclaimed a National Monument on January 9, 1908. It now holds 553
        acres.</p>

        <p style="color:blue;">Most of the chapters for Driven by The Past: A Road Trip Through the American West are “Exits” off of the
            history highway of the American West. Other chapters are “Forks in the Road” where we explore key decisions
            which altered the course of the history of the West. If you would like to read a sample chapter, please send
            a request to me at jonhunner6@gmail.com.</p>

        As I entered the Visitor Center at Golden Spike NHS, I read these words over the door: “Inscribed here, amid the
        sagebrush and bedrock of northern Utah is a tale of grand dreams and brute work, greed and glory.” Brute force,
        daring engineering, and profit supported by federal financing all muscled the railroad across the continent. At
        this site, a massive engineering and construction effort connected the Pacific and Atlantic coasts and helped
        unite the fractured country after the Civil War. Tens of thousands of workers carved a path almost 1,800 miles
        across prairies and mountains, laying wooden ties and iron rails, and completed the nation’s first
        transcontinental railroad line.</p>
    <p>The earliest steam-powered railroads rolled in England when George Stephenson in Wales operated the first
        publicly supported train in 1825. After arriving in the States, railroads expanded westward with some
        politicians envisioning going all the way to the West Coast. In 1850, the U.S. House of Representatives’
        “Committee on Roads and Canals” stated that a Pacific Railroad would "cement the commercial, social, and
        political relations of the East and the West," as well as providing a "highway over which will pass the commerce
        of Europe and Asia." Several years later, Congress ordered the Army to search for the best transcontinental
        routes. The engineers surveyed four routes but with the sectional discord building towards the Civil War,
        neither the north nor the south wanted a track that would benefit the other region.</p>
    <p>In California, Theodore Judah also dreamed of a Pacific Railroad and explored the Sierra Nevada mountains for a
        practical route through those forbidding peaks. In 1860, he interested Leland Stanford, Collis P. Huntington,
        Mark Hopkins, and Charles and Edwin Crocker in his dream, and so they incorporated the Central Pacific Railroad
        Company of California (CP). Later, these men built fortunes beyond their wildest imaginations from their
        railroad investments. For example, Leland Stanford went on to serve as a U.S. senator for California from 1885
        to 1893 and founded Stanford University with the profits from his railroads.</p>

        </fig2>
        Coming from the east, the Union Pacific (UP), established by Congress’s Pacific Railway Act in 1862, was a
        federally chartered corporation. To help with the expenses of building a railroad across the country, a
        Congressional act in 1862 and another in 1864 lent $50,000,000 to the CP and the UP to help with the substantial
        start-up costs. Additionally, the Pacific Railway Act of 1864 supported the building of the transcontinental
        line by loaning the two railroads $16,000 for each mile constructed east of the Rockies and west of the Sierras,
        $32,000 for each mile between the mountain ranges, and $48,000 for each mile in the mountains. In 1863,
        President Lincoln chose Omaha, Nebraska as the eastern terminus for the Union Pacific line; however for the rest
        of the Civil War, little was accomplished as labor and materials went to the fighting.</p>
    <p>Congress gave the two companies the property on their right of ways as well as additional grants of land for
        every mile of track. In other words, for every mile laid, the companies received ten sections (or ten square
        miles) alternating out from their main line. In total, the Union Pacific received the square mileage of New
        Hampshire and New Jersey combined, while Central Pacific’s take equaled the land mass of Maryland. Eventually,
        other railroads around the country cashed in on these land grants and collected 131,230,358 acres of land from
        the United States. To this day, railroad companies continue to own large amounts of land, especially in the
        American West.</p>

        Railroad construction on the Pacific route went full throttle after the Civil War. To build a railroad in the 1860s,
        a near level track bed had to be carved out or a mountain tunneled through before the rails were laid. It took 400
        iron rails to lay down a mile of track. Each rail was secured to the wooden ties underneath by 24 spikes. Each spike
        took three blows to nail it in. Thus, each mile of track took 12,000 blows of a sledge hammer in a “grand anvil
        chorus.” Multiply this over 1,800 miles, and you get an idea of the labor involved in muscling the railroad across
        the continent.</p>
    <p>The Central Pacific had a more challenging route than the UP. Almost immediately after leaving Sacramento, CP climbed
        up the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Steep switchbacks and tunneling through the granite of the Sierra Nevadas sometimes
        reduced progress to just eight inches a day. The CP reached the top of the Sierras in July 1867, and a year later
        had descended the high mountains to link up with its ongoing construction across the Nevada desert. To climb up and
        over the mountains, the CP hired 11,000 Chinese to grade land, dynamite cuts and tunnels, construct bridges and
        culverts, lay track, and hammer home the rails. Without the Chinese, the CP section of the Pacific Railroad would
        have taken much longer to complete.</p>

        </fig2>
        On May 10, 1869, at Promontory Summit, Utah, the “Jupiter” locomotive from Central Pacific and “Engine No. 119” from
        Union Pacific slowly chugged toward each other to mark the completion of the transcontinental railroad. The last
        rail was laid and a golden spike symbolically tapped into place. Engraved on the spike was: “May God continue the
        unity of our country as the railroad unites the two great Oceans of the world.” As the gathered crowd celebrated, an
        iron spike quickly replaced the golden one. To arrive at Promontory Summit, the CP laid 690 miles of track while UP
        put down 1,086. The golden spike signified the great engineering, political, and economic innovations of building a
        railroad across 1,776 miles of the American West.</p>
     <p>At the Golden Spike National Historic Site, I talked with Chief of Interpretation Justin Glasgow. He told me that
        this spot transformed the U.S. from a regional economy into a world power and helped the nation recover from the
        Civil War. The transcontinental railroad changed the role of the federal government by using public monies to
        support private businesses which resulted in substantial profits. The railroads also altered the way people
        experienced time and space. Prior to trains, we often measured time by how far one could travel in a day. Now
        distances that had taken days to traverse were covered in hours. Lands distant from markets were connected to
        regional and even national and international businesses and customers. Railroads enabled farmers, miners, lumbermen,
        and other producers to send their goods across vast distances to markets. Finally, railroads opened up the middle
        part of the country to settlers who displaced Native Americans who had lived on that land for generations. Railroads
        transformed the country in many ways.</p>

        As we continued to chat, Justin added that railroads ignited the protest movements at the end of the 19th century. In
        reaction to the monopolies and high transportation costs of railroads, discontented farmers organized the Populist
        Reform movement which morphed into Progressive reforms at the turn of the 20th century.</p>
    <p>For better and for worse, the powerful influences of the railroads dominated the nation’s economy and politics for
        the rest of the Gilded Age and into the 20th Century. On one hand, the country increasingly industrialized and began
        to overtake countries in Europe and elsewhere in manufacturing output and commerce. On the other hand, railroads
        colluded with each other to create unfair business practices and monopolies and to corrupt public servants. The
        Depressions of 1857, 1873, and 1893 were partially sparked by the failure of banks caught up in reckless speculation
        on railroads. The excesses of railroads, banks, and other businesses during the Gilded Age eventually led to more
        government regulation after the turn of the 20th Century.</p>

            </fig2>
            Justin concluded that railroad culture and language are still with us. For example, the national time zones we use
        today came about in 1883 to facilitate the safe passage of railroads rocketing across our vast continent. Railroads
        continue to serve a vital role in our consumer culture as they move goods from factories and ports to stores around
        the nation. In fact, as I write this, I hear that lonesome whistle blow from a nearby Burlington Northern Santa Fe
        freight train crossing my city.</p>
        <p>I enjoyed a real treat during my visit to Golden Spike NHS. The site has replicas of the two famous locomotives which
        met here in 1869. Central Pacific’s Jupiter and Union Pacific’s Engine No. 119 operate in the summer and make short
        runs along the track outside of the Visitor Center. While I was there, the sixty-ton No. 119 sped past in all its
        glory – with whistle blowing, wheels clacking on the rails, and the steam locomotive chuffing out thick coal
        smoke.</p>
        Did the transcontinental railroad heal the country after the Civil War? No; however, it did bind the east and west together. The American public, tired of the war, embraced this uniting of the continent and the success of railroads which sped people and goods across our vast lands. The American West greatly benefited from the transcontinental railroad which reduced the travel time across the country from months to days.

            The rumble of heavy freight cars, the chugging of a locomotive, the wail of a train horn all evoke a nostalgia that
        appeals to millions of people. Railroads represent industrial power, emerging transportation technology, the rapid
        movement of people, as well as a romanticized past. The Golden Spike NHS preserves the monumental effort of a nation
        recovering from a civil war to reinvent itself as a united country. Tying together the Atlantic and Pacific coasts
        and the lands in between, putting its industrial might to work and building what many considered impossible, the
        transcontinental railroad connected not just the East with the West but the West with the rest of the world.</p>
        <p>Congress authorized the Golden Spike National Historic Site on July 30, 1965. The monument covers 2,735 acres in the
        high desert of the Great Basin.</p>

            Climbing out of Chaco Canyon, we had to decide. Should we hike the mile or so to Pueblo Alto or should we turn around? Our visit during the summer monsoon season ran into an afternoon thunderstorm with ominous dark clouds scuttling across the sky. Nearby lightning sparked the air. Should we risk getting caught on the high plateau or retreat to the canyon? Pueblo Alto does mean “high town,” and atop the plateau, we were lightning rods sticking out of the squat desert landscape. We hiked on to Pueblo Alto.
            On a plateau above Chaco Canyon rests the multi-room ruin of Pueblo Alto. With my friend and parkgonaut George, we had climbed up the cleft in the canyon’s cliff on a trail made eight hundred years ago.  Standing in Pueblo Alto’s ruins, buffeted by wind, we saw a broad road sweeping north toward the Aztec Ruins National Monument some fifty miles away. In fact, Pueblo Alto is one of the gateways into Chaco Canyon, the end of thousands of miles of roads which funneled peoples and goods to this center in the desert Southwest from 900 to 1150 C.E.

            Set at 5,000 feet above sea level amidst a parched landscape which gets less than ten inches of annual precipitation, the Four Corners region where the states of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah come together holds a sparse beauty of earthy tones, hardy plants, and wide-open spaces. Amid this arid terrain, the Ancestral Pueblo People (aka the Anasazi) created a sophisticated civilization a thousand years ago. The greater Chaco cultural region includes outliers in the four states and Mexico and is larger than Ireland. Mountain ranges frame the horizons, and mesas rise out of the ground like desert islands. Chaco Canyon slices through the center of the region for twenty miles with its mile-wide trough in northwestern New Mexico.

            I first visited Chaco Canyon some forty years ago and quickly felt the magic of the place and its builders. Its largest ruin is Pueblo Bonito, a 650 room D-shaped structure which spreads over two acres. The long edge of the D faces south for solar gain but also for the important orientation along the cardinal points treasured by the Chacoans. Pueblo Bonito, begun in the 10th century C.E., rose five stories. Until the 20th century, it was the largest built structure in the United States.

            For three centuries, Pueblo Bonito grew larger and larger; it was complicated planning on a massive scale.
            Take for instance the wooden roof beams (or vigas). Excavations of the earliest vigas show that they came
            from nearby piñon trees. In order to build their pueblo, Chacoans quickly deforested the local trees and

            so had to travel some distance for their timber. At the Chuska Mountains fifty miles away, work crews
            felled large ponderosa pines with stones axes. While still green and soft, Chacoans chopped them into
            the right size for the various rooms and left them to dry for two years.
            Then they carried the lighter but hardened logs the fifty miles to build rooms in the great
            pueblos and kivas at Chaco. Archeologist Jim Judge told me that the Chacoans used 215,000 vigas
            in building the Great Houses and other structures in Chaco Canyon.

            In the 1980s, Jim led a multiyear long excavation and research project at Chaco. I got to know him several years ago when I led a study group of high school history teachers to Chaco, and we hired him for a day long exploration of the park. Wearing a sweat stained wide-brimmed cloth hat, his face permanently creased by the sun, he toured us around and shared his intimate knowledge of Chaco and its people. With him, we walked on an ancient stairway carved into the desert rock while he speculated on how people lived here.
            For more than a century, archeologists have argued over why humans established a dense urban complex in this harsh desert setting. Chacoan expert Craig Childs sums up the controversy: “The evidence gathered from a century of digging and mapping can support nearly any speculation thrown at Chaco Canyon: religious center, military center, government center, economic center, ceremonial center—the list is extensive.”  Some have speculated that the canyon served as a distribution center to share the harvest around the Chacoan region to communities whose crops had failed. Others proposed that it was a seasonal ceremonial center, visited by peoples from the outlying communities. Jim told us a peculiar fact—there are relatively few burials at Chaco Canyon. Perhaps the large pueblos with hundreds of rooms permanently housed only a couple of thousand people, but then the population swelled during seasonal rituals and festivals. Nobody knows for sure.
            Here’s where Chaco gets even more fascinating.

            </figure>

            Rising up out of the east end of the canyon near the NPS’s Visitor Center is Fajada Butte, a tall lone mesa. Near the top of the mesa, archaeo-astronomer Anna Sofaer spied a spiral petroglyph carved into a cliff face hidden behind three large stone slabs. On the summer solstice in 1977, Sofaer saw a streak of sunlight slip through the slabs and bisect the shadowed spiral. Later, she observed that during the equinoxes, a dagger of light framed one side or the other of the spiral. She called it the “Sun Dagger.” To announce the solstices and equinoxes to people throughout the whole Chaco region, a fire lit on top of Fajada Butte sparked other fires on far-flung mesa tops.
            The Chacoans incorporated more about the movement of the heavens into their built environment. As Sofaer of the Solstice Project observed: “The major buildings of the ancient Chacoan culture of New Mexico contain solar and lunar cosmology in three separate articulations: their orientations, internal geometry, and geographic interrelationships were developed in the relationship to the cycles of the sun and the moon.”  Using their built environment as time pieces, the Ancestral Pueblo People had a precise seasonal calendar.
            One of Chaco’s buildings performs an even more amazing feat: it tracks the 18.6-year progression of where the moon rises in the east.

            </fig2>
            At the pueblo of Chetro Ketl, Jim pointed out that the back wall runs along a straight line for about 300 feet. This alignment points to the spot (called the Lunar Standstill by astronomers) on a nearby cliff where the moon rises on the farthest northern point of its 18.6-year cycle. Jim said that the Chacoans may have aligned the long back wall of Chetro Ketl precisely to the Lunar Standstill on the nearby horizon. However, he equivocated a bit by also saying that maybe they built the wall here because it was close to the rock source at the base of a cliff. Nobody knows, but other Native American NPS sites at Chimney Rock in Colorado (a Chacoan outlier) and at Hopewell Mounds in Ohio also align to the Northern Lunar Standstill.

            Roads radiating out from the canyon interconnected the greater Chaco region. Ancient stairs carved into the cliff faces funneled people into and out of the canyon where they traveled to over 150 other Great Houses and beyond on roads eighteen feet wide lined with stone curbs. Sea shells from the Pacific Ocean, soapstone from the Midwest, and amazingly, feathers of thirty-seven Scarlet Macaw parrots from the tropics of Central America have surfaced in the excavations at Chaco.
            As we stood in the middle of the plaza at Pueblo Bonito, Jim told us about a puzzling event. In 1941, NPS personnel wanted to stabilize a part of the cliff face that had detached from the wall and hovered dangerously over this main pueblo. They cleaned out the cleft at the base of the cliff, and at the bottom of the debris pile, they found a Macaw parrot feather attached to a prayer stick.  It had been deposited there 800 years ago. The rangers removed that too. During a storm a couple of weeks later, this part of the cliff finally collapsed and smashed a section of Pueblo Bonito. Jim wondered aloud if the binding energy of the prayer stick had prevented the wall from collapsing across all of those centuries.
            In many of the plazas of the pueblos at Chaco and interspersed among their numerous rooms are often circular kivas where clans gathered to worship, socialize, teach, and work. Just at Pueblo Bonito, thirty-five kivas grace the ruin. Inside a kiva in the central plaza, Jim pointed out some foot-high rectangular stone structures. He called them foot drums and asked us to imagine deer skins pulled taut over the openings with people dancing on top of them. The dancing would fill the kiva and indeed the whole plaza with a penetrating rhythm. On a later visit to Chaco while
            <figure>

                <figcaption>Foot-drums in a kiva at Pueblo Bonito</figcaption>
            </figure>
            looking at the foot drums, I heard a rumble and thought a plane was flying low overhead. But then I saw a car speeding by a quarter mile away, its roar bouncing off the cliff faces above the pueblo and showing how sound reflected back onto the plaza.
            Across the dry wash from Pueblo Bonito stood Casa Riconada, the Great Kiva at the heart of the canyon. Jim gave his last lecture to us here.  The building’s circular structure spans some sixty feet across --  so big was it that it had no roof. On its floor were some foot drums, a fire pit, and a sipapu, the opening from the underworld which humans used to come into this world. As Jim leaned against the rock wall of the kiva in the late afternoon light, he mentioned his years working at Chaco and that he often brought his teenage son with him. His son, Mike, had expressed a desire to be a scientist, but being around the magic of Chaco and its sacred connections, he later changed his mind and went into TV and film. Mike Judge eventually wrote and produced Office Space, Beavis and Butt-head, and King of the Hill. Jim attributes that to the influence of Chaco’s otherworldly nature on his son.

            Around 1150 C.E., the Chacoans left the canyon. Why? No one knows. Their abrupt exodus remains a mystery. Here are some theories: perhaps communities collapsed as the multiyear drought in the middle of the 12th century fried the region’s corn and bean fields. Or perhaps a new wave of migrants swept violently through the region, disrupting its social centers. Or perhaps it was a part of a centuries long cycle. In the movie at the nearby Aztec Ruins National Monument’s Visitor Center, Loris Ann Taylor from the Pueblo of Hopi provided a Native American answer: she said this is just a part of her people’s journey to fulfill their spiritual role as stewards of the land. She concluded: “It was simply time to move on.”
            Craig Childs, who has extensively explored the region driven by his passion for tracking the Ancestral Puebloans, agrees with Taylor: “The Southwest seems to be a landscape built for migration…. In my mind it is all about movement, about erosion and drought, and places where you search for water.”  Americans from the beginning were intrepid migrants who traveled across the landscape, in a perpetual cycle of searching for water, game, meaning, and sustenance for the body and the spirit.
            Leaving Chaco Canyon, Ancestral Puebloans moved to more defensive positions but in a well-ordered manner. They dissembled the roofs of their kivas and burned the vigas. At Aztec Ruins, archeologists estimate that the roof of its Great Kiva weighed ninety tons so this demolition would have taken weeks. The end of Great Houses of the Chacoans was not a panicked fleeing, but an orderly, natural, and, not surprisingly for the master builders of the Southwest, planned event.
            The diaspora from Chaco spread in all directions. Leaving the Chaco Valley, they migrated to places with more abundant and steady sources of water like the San Juan River to the north and the Rio Grande to the east. Many of the modern pueblos in northern New Mexico and Arizona are descendants of the Ancestral Pueblo People.
            Some retreated to canyons and cliff dwellings of southeast Utah and recently, women from the region wrote an opinion piece for the New York Times where they said: “We are rooted to the land, the medicines, the water, and all beings that give life. Just like the spiral pattern on our fingertips and at the top of our heads, we live life in a circular way of thinking, planning, and reflecting. We are always taught to gift back as a way to renew and sustain the spiritual energy, cycle of seasons and the natural order of life.”
            At the Bandelier National Monument (settled in the 13th century by Chacoans), today’s Puebloans note that “Spiritually, our ancestors still live here at Bandelier. You see reminders of their presence here—their homes, their kivas, and their petroglyphs. As you walk in their footsteps, value the earth beneath you and show everything the same respect we do when we re-visit this sacred place.”
            Many of today’s Pueblo People in the Southwest, while accommodating modern America, offer us an alternative world view rooted in their past, rooted in their ancestral Chaco culture.

            After decades of exploring the impressive ruins of Chaco Canyon, of climbing ancient stairways, of hiking across the desert plateaus on wide roads lined with boulders, I am still awed by the people who lived here so long ago. With stone tools, they fashioned a complex civilization which built massive structures that aligned with the movement of the heavens and the passage of the seasons. Their roads brought their dispersed peoples to the canyon and sent out others to trade with distant civilizations, some as far away as 1,500 miles. From this canyon, people spread Chaco culture across deserts and mountains. Many Native Americans living in today’s pueblos in New Mexico and Arizona trace their ancestry to this canyon. It is one of the most astonishing places in the West.

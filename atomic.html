            Unlike most of the stops on this road trip to historic sites, the next places are vibrant
            cities. In fact, they are centers not only for cutting edge research and development from the past,
            but for the future as well. Los Alamos, New Mexico and Hanford, Washington (along with their
            sister Manhattan Project town of Oak Ridge in Tennessee), were instant cities created during
            World War II to invent an atomic bomb. They have continued to operate as world class
            laboratories for studying not just nuclear weapons, but exploring radioactive waste disposal,
            nuclear medicine, high speed computers, lasers, human genomes, and alternative energy. Some
            say this all started with the ancient Greeks.
            Greek philosophers as far back as the 5 th Century B.C.E. had theorized about a tiny unit
            of matter which they called “atomos” meaning indivisible. Twenty-four centuries later, Einstein’s
            E=mc 2 predicted that if an atom was divided, an enormous amount of energy would be released.
            In Berlin in 1938, physicists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassman bombarded a lump of uranium with
            neutrons which to their surprise released excessive heat and the element boron. When they sent
            their puzzling findings to Lise Meitner, a Jewish colleague who had fled to Sweden, she and her
            nephew Otto Frisch realized that Hahn and Strassman had split the atom. Not knowing what to
            call it, they came up with “fission,” borrowed from biology. Hahn and Strassman’s discovery
            swept through the world of nuclear physics like a crown-jumping forest fire with the fear that the
            Nazis had leapt ahead in harnessing the power of the atom for military purposes.</p>

        <p>The fear increased as Germany conquered large parts of Europe and killed millions of
            people. Japan also invaded its neighbors and killed millions more. Overall, as many as
            75,000,000 civilians and military personnel around the globe lost their lives during World War II.
            The European war ending in April 1945, but how would the Allies achieve a similar victory over
            Japan? The answer on how to end this horrific war came from the American West. Oddly
            enough, those two scientists in pre-war Germany provided the key.
            With Hahn and Strassman splitting the atom and a rising animosity by Hitler against
            Britain, research intensified in England. Then after Pearl Harbor, as the U.S. joined Britain as an
            ally, President Franklin Roosevelt ordered the Army Corps of Engineers to build an atom bomb
            under the code name the Manhattan Project. General Leslie Groves, who had just built the
            Pentagon, took command of the project and faced several vital decisions. First, where to locate
            the key facilities? The project needed an isolated central research laboratory as well as separate
            sites to manufacture the materials of an atomic weapon. Second, Groves needed to find a
            knowledgeable person to direct the laboratory where scientists, engineers, and munitions’ experts
            would create an atomic bomb.

            </fig2>
            For lab director, Groves chose Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer, a prominent theoretical
            physicist who taught at the University of California, Berkeley. As a teenager from New York
            City, he had become enamored with the West, even later stating that New Mexico and physics
            were the two loves of his life. When hired at Berkeley in 1929, Oppie (as friends and colleagues
            called him) vowed to establish a distinguished department of physics to the American West.
            Once Groves picked Oppie, they searched the West for a suitable location for the central
            research lab. In November 1942, Oppie showed Groves Los Alamos, an exclusive boys’ school
            in the mountains of northern New Mexico. The general chose the site that night during a steak

            dinner in nearby Santa Fe. In December, as the boys school got orders to vacate, bulldozers
            started preparing the plateau for a top secret facility which changed human history.
            Oppie recruited Nobel Prize winning scientists, émigré physicists, graduate students, and
            many others to join his team at Los Alamos. Arriving in Spring 1943, they set about
            experimenting on how to create an atomic explosion. Essential to their work was nuclear
            material produced at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and Hanford, Washington.
            To split an atom and create an explosion, atoms need to be slightly unstable, that is, they
            need to have an imbalance between their electrons and protons. Scientists identified two
            elements suitable for such work—uranium and plutonium. At Oak Ridge, using massive
            centrifuges and microscopic filters, workers extracted from naturally occurring uranium ore
            (Uranium 238) atoms of the rare and more unstable isotope of Uranium 235 .
            Making plutonium required a different method.

                <figcaption>Nuclear Reactors at Hanaford Washington</figcaption>
            </figure>

            At the Hanford nuclear reactor,
            bombarding uranium ore by neutrons turned it into a totally man-made element, plutonium. On
            my visit to the Reach Museum in Hanford, docent and retired nuclear scientist Gary Busselman
            explained the process. Uranium rods weighing eight pounds each were irradiated by neutrons at
            Reactor B, producing small spots of plutonium the size of a pen point. From scraping such
            miniscule amounts off the rods, scientists eventually collected enough plutonium (around 17
            pounds) to create an atomic explosion.
            Scientists at Los Alamos experimented with both uranium and plutonium as soon as the
            material arrived. Using a traditional bomb concept, scientists focused on shooting a plug of
            Uranium 235 into a larger amount of the same material which sparked off neutrons that split other
            atoms, creating a chain reaction, and an atomic explosion. Scientists nicknamed this bomb Little
            Boy.</p>

        <p>This method did not work for plutonium, so scientists came up with an innovative
            technique—an implosion bomb. Engineers surrounded a core of plutonium with conventional
            explosives and detonated them at exactly the same moment. The converging shock wave on the
            grapefruit sized pit of plutonium split atoms, ejecting neutrons which caused more fissions and
            released an fiery amount of energy. This device was called Fat Man.
            By summer 1945, scientists prepared to test the plutonium bomb. They were convinced
            that Little Boy would work, but not so sure about Fat Man. So they left Los Alamos and drove
            south to a stretch of desert that Spanish conquistadors had called Jornada del Muerto (Dead
            Man’s Journey). Oppie named it the Trinity Site. At 5:29 a.m. on July 16, 1945, Fat Man
            imploded in the desert of New Mexico. The flash from the blast lit up the pre-dawn sky, and
            people in New Mexico, Texas, Arizona, and Mexico saw it.

            </fig2>

            Joan Hinton, a graduate student in physics working at the lab, observed the fireball from
            a hill twenty-five miles away: “It was like being at the bottom of an ocean of light. We were
            bathed in it from all directions. The light withdrew into the bomb as if the bomb sucked it up.
            Then it turned purple and blue and went up and up and up…. Then suddenly the sound reached
            us. It was very sharp and rumbled and all the mountains were rumbling with it.” After the
            luminous mushroom cloud rose like the sun, it dissipated, and then the real sun came up. Some
            said they saw the sun rise twice that day. Today, Trinity is open to the public twice a year. Last
            time I visited with my students, I put a Geiger counter on the dirt near Ground Zero, and it
            registered levels of radioactivity some 100 times higher than the parking lot a quarter mile away.
            Fat Man at Trinity had detonated with the equivalent force of eighteen tons of TNT. With
            confidence in the bombs, Groves sent the other Fat Man as well as Little Boy to Japan to end the
            war. The uranium bomb exploded over Hiroshima and the plutonium one over Nagasaki in</p>

        <p>August 1945. At both Japanese cities, thousands were vaporized at the moment of detonation
            from the heat of the man-made suns, leaving only their shadows etched on sidewalks and
            buildings. Thousands more died from shock-waves as buildings collapsed or as shrapnel from
            blown apart structures pierced them. Thousands more perished from the fire storms that ravaged
            the atomic landscapes for days after the explosions. Newspapers of the day reported that a single
            atomic bomb packed the equivalent destructive force of 2,000 fully loaded B-29 Superfortress
            bombers.
            In addition to this quantum leap in destructive power, the bombs introduced a new
            lethality to the battlefields. At the moment of the explosion, gamma rays released from the
            splitting of the atoms radiated humans and burned their internal organs. These damaged organs
            failed to process the vital fluids necessary for life, and people died, often taking weeks to
            painfully succumb. The atomic bombs also scattered unexploded radioactive uranium and
            plutonium as fallout. If breathed or ingested, these particles could cause cancers and other health
            issues decades later.
            Hiroshima’s death toll from the August 6 bombing totaled 60,000 to 70,000 dead while
            between 40,000 and 50,000 died from the August 9 Nagasaki explosion. Tens of thousands more
            people succumbed to the radiation exposure in the weeks and years that followed. This
            devastating new weapon forced Japan to surrender.
            To be clear, the war against Japan had already been won. It had been won by the Allied
            soldiers and sailors, by factories on the home front, and by farmers in the hinterlands. It was only
            a matter of time before Japan’s defeat; however the atomic weapons ended the war that August.
            The atomic bombs made a bloody invasion of the Japanese home islands unnecessary. Perhaps it
            took such a horrendous weapon to end the most horrific war in human history.</p>

        <p>The Cold War nuclear arms race between the U.S. and the Soviet Union created hydrogen
            bombs, some of them 1,000 times more powerful than those used over Japan. The American
            West played a major role in testing these new weapons at the Nevada Test Site north of Las
            Vegas which detonated almost 1,000 tests – 100 above ground and the rest underground. The
            National Atomic Testing Museum in Las Vegas presents that history with exhibits and a
            simulated explosion in their theater with a shock wave of air and seats that rattle and roll.
            During the Cold War, the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. held each other at bay with a policy
            called “M.A.D.” (Mutually Assured Destruction). I call it “Cliocide.” In ancient Greece, Clio
            was the muse of history. If nuclear war destroys the Earth, it would be the murder of history, thus
            Cliocide.

            </fig2>


            The end of the Cold War edged us back from a nuclear Armageddon; however a new war
            in Eastern Europe and potentially in Asia has renewed fears of such a conflict. Additionally, the
            environmental legacy of nuclear waste persists. For example, plutonium remains toxic for over
            240,000 years. Other radioactive elements such as Iodine 131 , Strontium 90 , and Cesium 137 have
            shorter lifespans but also can cause cancers. The Department of Energy (which operates the
            country’s nuclear sites) spends billions each year to store the waste but struggles with how to get
            rid of such toxic material.
            Another legacy is how to preserve this history? In November 2015, I participated in a
            Scholars’ Forum to help the NPS figure out how to interpret the newly created Manhattan Project
            National Historical Parks. For two days, some twenty-five atomic historians, community
            members, staff from NPS, Department of Energy, and Army Corps of Engineers, as well as two
            Japanese representatives from Hiroshima and Nagasaki discussed how to present the history of
            the Manhattan Project.</p>

        <p>We discussed how to tell the story of the Manhattan Project, including the key scientific
            discoveries, the war leading up to the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, nuclear
            environmental legacy, and the Cold War. The representatives from Japan’s Atomic Cities were
            not so interested in discussing the questions that us atomic historians grapple with; however, they
            clearly stated several times (and produced letters from their mayors saying the same) that they
            hoped that visitors would come away from their encounter with the Manhattan Project NHP
            vowing “Never Again.” We all agreed with them. The interpretive plans for these parks continue
            to unfold at Los Alamos, Oak Ridge, and Hanford.
            The legacy of the Manhattan Project is manifold. It end World War II in August 1945.
            Nuclear weapons helped the United States create an “American Century” after the war, securing
            our place as a superpower. Nuclear weapons entered the arsenals of other countries at enormous
            costs in funding and material. Even today, decades after the end of the Cold War, we spend
            billions on maintaining our own nuclear stockpile. The FY 2023 budget just for Los Alamos
            National Laboratory was $4,000,000,000. And the environmental legacy of nuclear weapons’
            production will continue to affect the globe for thousands of years to come.
            Since most of our nation’s nuclear facilities reside in the West, they helped transform this
            region into a pace-setter for the rest of the nation. It also attracted thousands of families to places
            where they might not have lived. My family is an example. After fighting in the Pacific during
            the war, my father transferred to the atomic arm of the Air Force in the 1950s and for the rest of
            his career, worked to safeguard the bases where we stored nuclear weapons mainly in the West. I
            was in college before I realized that not everybody’s family had photos of atomic blasts hung on
            their family room walls.</p>


        <p>The innovations of the Manhattan Project continue to shape our lives with what Oppie called the
            promise and the peril of the atomic age. Today, 20% of U.S. electricity comes from nuclear
            plants, and in France, they depend on them for more than 75%. Nuclear medicine has
            transformed how we diagnose and treat a variety of our ills, from being to look inside our bodies
            to killing cancer cells. Historians in the future will look at the creation and development of
            nuclear weapons in the American West as perhaps the most important event in the 20 th century,
            rivaling human flight, the moon landing, and the Digital Revolution—that is if we don’t commit
            Cliocide.</p>

        <p>The Manhattan Project National Historical Parks with units at Hanford, Washington, Los
            Alamos, New Mexico, and Oak Ridge, Tennessee became part of the NPS on Nov. 9, 2015 with a
            joint memorandum of understanding between the Departments of Interior and Energy. 1</p>
